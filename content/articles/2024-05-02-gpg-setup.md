Because it can be overwhelming, I have documented my setup to properly use GPG, YubiKeys and more. This was mainly used as my own notes, but it might also be valuable to you, if you are looking to step up your security game.

<!-- more -->

The entire setup had to be performed on an always offline computer.


## Temporary directory

Export a temporary directory for the key-ring that will be cleared on reboot:

```sh
export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d -t gnupg_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)_XXX)
```

## Master Key
This key is used to revoke or issue new sub-keys. It should be kept offline at all times.

[[Choose a secure passphrase]] and use it to generate a master key that only has the `cert` capability:

```sh
gpg --quick-generate-key "Philipp Schaffrath <philipp.schaffrath@gmail.com>" rsa4096 cert 0
```

{% admonition(type="info") %}
Use `ed25519` instead of `rsa4096` if the hardware/software supports it.
{% end %}

And export its id for later use:

```sh
export KEYID=$(gpg --list-options show-only-fpr-mbox --list-secret-keys | awk '{print $1}') # 3632EF2A8B78A18347878D337F5E34A205B6F126
```

## Sub-keys

Add sub-keys for signing, encryption and authentication:

```sh
gpg --quick-add-key "$KEYID" rsa4096 sign 1y
gpg --quick-add-key "$KEYID" rsa4096 encrypt 1y
gpg --quick-add-key "$KEYID" rsa4096 auth 1y
```

{% admonition(type="info") %}
Use `ed25519` instead of `rsa4096` (and `cv25519` for the encrypt key) if the hardware/software supports it.
{% end %}

## Verify

Ensure the generated keys have the correct uid, expiration dates, key types and capabilities:

```sh
gpg -K
```

You should have a master key (`sec`) with the certificate `[C]` capability, and three sub keys (`ssb`) with sign `[S]`, encrypt `[E]` and authenticate `[A]` capabilities respectively.

Use `hokey lint` to check if the keys follow best practices:

```sh
gpg --export "$KEYID" | hokey lint
```

{% admonition(type="note") %}
An expiration date on the cert key is pointless, since it can be used to extend itself.

The warning about cross certification for the authentication key can be ignored, since it does not need to sign, we have generated a separate key for this.

{% end %}


## Backup

The external backup storage device will contain an encrypted partition containing the secret keys, and an unencrypted one for the public keys.

{% admonition(type="warning") %}
Repeat this section for at least 2 storage devices, store them in separate, secure locations, and regularly create backups on new storage devices to circumvent losing your backups due to data degradation.
{% end %}

### Preparing storage device

Attach an external storage device and identify it with `sudo fdisk -l`.

{% admonition(type="danger") %}
Double check the device to not overwrite the wrong one!
{% end %}

Overwrite it with random data to prepare for encryption:

```sh
sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

Create a new partition table and two partitions with 25 Megabyte size each:

```sh
sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
g # create a new empty GPT partition table
n # add a new partition
↲ # default partition number (1)
↲ # default first sector (2048)
+25M # last sector
n # add a new partition
↲ # default partition number (2)
↲ # default first sector (53248)
+25M # last sector
w # write table to disk and exit
```

[[Choose a secure passphrase]], use it to encrypt the first partition using LUKS and open it:

```sh
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX1
YES # to confirm
<BACKUP_STORAGE_PASSPHRASE>
<BACKUP_STORAGE_PASSPHRASE>
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX1 private
<BACKUP_STORAGE_PASSPHRASE>
```

Create a filesystem for both the encrypted and unencrypted partitions:

```sh
sudo mkfs.ext2 /dev/mapper/private -L gpg-private
sudo mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdX2 -L gpg-public
```

And mount both filesystems:

```sh
sudo mkdir /mnt/private /mnt/public
sudo mount /dev/mapper/private /mnt/private
sudo mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt/public
```

### Export secret keys
Export the private master and sub keys to the backup device:

```sh
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys "$KEYID" | sudo tee /mnt/private/secret-keys.asc > /dev/null
# <MASTER_KEY_PASSPHRASE>
gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys "$KEYID" | sudo tee /mnt/private/secret-subkeys.asc > /dev/null
# <MASTER_KEY_PASSPHRASE>
```

{% admonition(type="info") %}
Both master and sub-keys are encrypted with your passphrase when exported.
{% end %}

### Revocation certificate

Generate a revocation certificate and store it on the backup device:

```sh
gpg --gen-revoke "$KEYID" | sudo tee /mnt/private/revoke.asc > /dev/null
y # create revocation certificate for this key
1 # Key has been compromised
↲ # no description
y # okay
<MASTER_KEY_PASSPHRASE>
```

{% admonition(type="warning") %}
Print this out for the worst case in which all your backups fail.
{% end %}


### Export public keys

Export and backup the public sub and ssh keys:

```sh
gpg --armor --export "$KEYID" | sudo tee /mnt/public/public-keys.asc > /dev/null
gpg --export-ssh-key "$KEYID" | sudo tee /mnt/public/ssh-key.pub > /dev/null
```

{% admonition(type="info") %}
Public sub keys are needed for encryption, signature and identity verification. The SSH key export is just your auth key in a format that can be used as a public SSH key.
{% end %}

#### Upload to Key-Servers

The public key can and probably should be uploaded to a key-server.

{% admonition(type="info") %}
This requires an internet connection! Only do this **after** all sensitive data (private keys, passphrases, mounted backups) have been wiped off the system. You can do this step at any point in the future.
{% end %}

```sh
gpg --send-key "$KEYID"
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key "$KEYID"
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-key "$KEYID"
gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --send-key "$KEYID"
```

{% admonition(type="info") %}
After some time, the key will propagate to other key-servers.
{% end %}

#### Downloading from Key-Server

Once the public key has been uploaded to key-servers, it can be easily retrieved as well:

```sh
gpg --recv "$KEYID"
```

If you retrieve your public keys this way, you also want to set ultimate trust:

```sh
gpg --edit-key "$KEYID"
trust
5 # I trust ultimately
y # really set key to ultimate trust
quit
```

### Removing storage device

{% admonition(type="info") %}
If you want to setup **multiple** YubiKeys, postpone this step and keep this device mounted until they are all setup.
{% end %}

Unmount partitions and close the encrypted volume:

```sh
sudo umount /mnt/public
sudo umount /mnt/private
sudo cryptsetup luksClose private
```

And finally unplug the device and store it in a safe location.

{% admonition(type="info") %}
Store your backups in separate locations, in case one gets compromised.
{% end %}

## Restoring a backup

If you still have your temporary `$GNUPGHOME`, delete its content and restart the gpg agent:

```sh
rm -rf $GNUPGHOME/*
y # delete all n files
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```

Identify the storage device that contains the backup with `sudo fdisk -l` and mount it:

```sh
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX1 private
<BACKUP_STORAGE_PASSPHRASE>
sudo mkdir /mnt/private /mnt/public
sudo mount /dev/mapper/private /mnt/private
sudo mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt/public
```

Import the public and private keys:

```sh
gpg --import /mnt/public/public-keys.asc
gpg --import /mnt/private/secret-keys.asc
<MASTER_KEY_PASSPHRASE>
```

Set ultimate trust for the imported key:

```sh
gpg --edit-key "$KEYID"
trust
5 # I trust ultimately
y # really set key to ultimate trust
quit
```

And finally, unmount your backup:

```sh
sudo umount /mnt/private
sudo cryptsetup luksClose private
```

## YubiKey Setup

A plugged in YubiKey can be configured using `gpg`:

```sh
gpg --card-edit
```

### Change PINs

The `gpg` interface has a PIN, Admin PIN and Reset Code, which should all be changed from their defaults.

| Name       | Default    | Used for                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PIN        | `123456`   | encrypt, decrypt, authenticate, sign                                                         |
| Admin PIN  | `12345678` | reset **PIN**, change **Reset Code**, add keys and owner information                         |
| Reset code | _**None**_ | reset **PIN** ([more information](https://forum.yubico.com/viewtopicd01c.html?p=9055#p9055)) |

{% admonition(type="info") %}
Entering the **PIN** incorrectly three times will cause the **PIN** to become blocked. It can be unblocked with either the **Admin PIN** or **Reset Code**.
{% end %}

{% admonition(type="danger") %}
Entering the **Admin PIN** or **Reset Code** incorrectly three times will destroy all GPG data on the card. The Yubikey will have to be reconfigured.
{% end %}

[[Choose a secure passphrase]] for your **Admin PIN** and **Reset Code**, and something you can remember for the **PIN**:

```sh
admin # to allow admin commands
passwd
```

{% admonition(type="info") %}
The allowed number of PIN, RESET_CODE and ADMIN_PIN retries can be changed using `ykman openpgp access set-retries 5 3 3`.
{% end %}


### Set Information

You can set information like your `name`, `language`, `login`, `salutation` or public key `url` using the respective command. Some of them are not required.

### Enable touch policy

Activate the touch policy that requires a physical touch following the entry of a **PIN** for signing, encryption, and authentication:

```sh
ykman openpgp keys set-touch SIG ON
# <ADMIN_PIN>
y # confirm
ykman openpgp keys set-touch ENC ON
# <ADMIN_PIN>
y # confirm
ykman openpgp keys set-touch AUT ON
# <ADMIN_PIN>
y # confirm
```

{% admonition(type="note") %}
The YubiKey will blink when it requires touch confirmation.
{% end %}

### Move Sub-Keys to YubiKey

{% admonition(type="warning") %}
Once private sub keys are moved to a YubiKey, they can't be exported anymore. Backups must be done before that!
{% end %}

Now that the keys are backed up safely, they can be moved to a YubiKey:

```sh
gpg --edit-key "$KEYID"
key 1 # select signature key
keytocard
y # Really move the primary key?
1 # Where to store: Signature key
y # Replace existing key
# <MASTER_KEY_PASSPHRASE>
# <ADMIN_PIN>
key 1 # unselect signature key
key 2 # select encryption key
keytocard
2 # Where to store: Encryption key
y # Replace existing key
# <MASTER_KEY_PASSPHRASE>
key 2 # unselect encryption key
key 3 # select authentication key
keytocard
3 # Where to store: Authentication key
y # Replace existing key
# <MASTER_KEY_PASSPHRASE>
q # quit
y # Save changes
```

#### Verify

Verify if the sub-keys have been moved to the YubiKey.

```sh
gpg -K
```

{% admonition(type="info", title="Validate if the keys have moved") %}
The sub keys should be prefixed with `ssb>`, which means it was moved to the YubiKey, rather than `ssb`, which indicates it is still on the system.
 
The master key should still be on the system `sec`, rather than `sec#` which means master key is not on the system anymore. 
{% end %}

#### Additional YubiKeys

To move the keys to an additional YubiKey, follow [[#Restoring a backup]], and then [[#Move Sub-Keys to YubiKey]]. Repeat that for as many YubiKeys you need to populate.

### Linking YubiKey on new device

To use your YubiKey on a new device, import the public keys:

```sh
gpg --import public-keys.asc
```

{% admonition(type="note") %}
If you followed [[#Upload to Key-Servers]], you can follow [[#Downloading from Key-Server]] instead!
{% end %}

Link it to the currently plugged in YubiKey:

```sh
gpg-connect-agent "scd serialno" "learn --force" /bye
```

And trust it ultimately:

```sh
gpg --edit-key $KEYID
trust
5 # I trust ultimately
y # yreally trust
quit
```

## Cleanup

Remove the backed up secret keys:

```sh
sudo srm -r $GNUPGHOME || sudo rm -rf $GNUPGHOME
gpg --delete-secret-key "$KEYID"
unset GNUPGHOME KEYID
```

{% admonition(type="note") %}
Or simply reboot to clean the temporary directories.
{% end %}
